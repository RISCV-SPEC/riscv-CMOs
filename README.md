# riscv-CMOs

Cache Management Operations (CMOs) for RISC-V

* Created by: 	Stephano Cetola
* Requested by: 	Andy Glew

TBD: working group

* https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs
* https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/wiki
* TBD: links that work when checked out locally as well as on GitHub

Key wiki pages
* [RISC-V needs CMOs, and hence a CMO Working Group](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/wiki/RISC-V-needs-CMOs%2C-and-hence-a-CMO-Working-Group)
  * email seeking WG approval and call for participation
* [CMOs WG Draft Proposed Charter](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/wiki/CMOs-WG-Draft-Proposed-Charter)
* [Draft CMO proposals](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/wiki/Draft-CMO-proposals)


Note:
* wiki more than repo: 
  * at the moment / at start, much of this wil be in the wiki rather than the repo
  * since much of my (Glew's) initial proposal was arranged in such a wiki-centric manner, with the repo mainly for build tools
