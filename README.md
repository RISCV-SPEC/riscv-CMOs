# riscv-CMOs

Cache Management Operations (CMOs) for RISC-V

* Created by: 	Stephano Cetola
* Requested by: 	Andy Glew

TBD: working group

* repo: [[riscv-CMOs/riscv-CMOs]]
* wiki: [[riscv-CMOs/riscv-CMOs/wiki]]

Note:
* wiki more than repo: 
  * at the moment / at start, much of this wil be in the wiki rather than the repo
  * since much of my (Glew's) initial proposal was arranged in such a wiki-centric manner, with the repo mainly for build tools
