# riscv-CMOs

Cache Management Operations (CMOs) for RISC-V

* Created by: 	Stephano Cetola
* Requested by: 	Andy Glew


* TBD: working group
* TBD: riscv mailing list


## Wiki-centric

The active work on the proposal is in the wiki.
Eventually it may be moved to the main repository,
although there are tools to assemble the actual proposed spec for
publication from the wiki directly.
Such tools,
also things like highlight unfinished parts of the proposal on the wiki,
will be placed in the main repository, i.e. here.

Q: is there a way to treat this project on github, both "main git repo" and "wiki git repo", as the same object? Otherwise will just check out the reps separately, and coordinate.
    * 5/7/2020: set up wiki as a submodule of repo
