[test] [[test2]]

Originally:  single repo+wiki riscv-CMOs, containing both proposal and wiki.

Want: 
* TG members able to post to wiki
* but draft proposals, minutes, etc., writeable by opnly a few people. 

Since GitHub access control seems to ve per-repo, we are splitting the original repo into two:

riscv-CMOs
* to contain protected stuff like drafys and minutes

riscv-CMOs-discuss 
* writeable by TG mrmbers
* e.g. wiki
   * TBD: publish how TG members can gain wiki post access
