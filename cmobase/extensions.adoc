CMO instructions are defined in the following extensions:

* <<#Zicbom>>
* <<#Zicboz>>
* <<#Zicbop>>

Cache-block management instructions operate on cache blocks containing the
effective address equal to the base address specified in _rs1_.

Cache-block zero instructions operate on cache blocks, or the memory locations
corresponding to cache blocks, containing the effective address equal to the
base address specified in _rs1_.

Cache-block prefetch instructions operate on cache blocks containing the
effective address equal to the sum of the base address specified in _rs1_ and a
sign-extended offset encoded in the _imm_ field, where offset[4:0] shall equal
0b00000.

In all cases, the effective address is translated into a corresponding physical
address by the appropriate translation mechanisms.
