CMO instructions are defined in the following extensions:

* <<#Zicbom>>
* <<#Zicboz>>
* Cache Block Prefetch Instructions (TBD)

Cache block management instructions and cache block zero instructions operate on
the cache block containing the effective address specified in _rs_. The
effective address is translated into a corresponding physical address by the
translation mechanisms appropriate in the effective privilege level.
