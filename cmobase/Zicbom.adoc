=== Cache Block Management Instructions

Cache block management instructions enable software running on a set of coherent
observers to communicate with a set of non-coherent observers by performing one
of the following operations:

* An _invalidate operation_ makes store operations from a set of non-coherent
  observers appear to the set of coherent observers at a point common to both
  sets by removing all copies of a cache block from the coherent caches up to
  that point
  
* A _clean operation_ makes store operations from the set of coherent observers
  appear to a set of non-coherent observers at a point common to both sets by
  performing a write operation of a copy of a cache block to that point,
  provided a coherent observer performed a store operation to the cache block
  since the previous such write operation
  
* A _flush operation_ atomically performs a clean operation followed by an
  invalidate operation

In the Zicbom extension, the instructions operate to a point common to _all_
observers in the system. In other words, an invalidate operation ensures that
store operations from all non-coherent observers appear to observers in the set
of coherent observers, and a clean operation ensures that store operations from
coherent observers appear to all non-coherent observers.

****

_The Zicbom extension does not prohibit observers that fall outside of the above
architectural definition; however, software cannot rely on the defined cache
operations to have the desired effects with respect to those observers._

_Future extensions may define different sets of observers for the purposes of
performance optimization._
