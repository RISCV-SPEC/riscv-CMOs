Description::
The *cbo.zero.ea* instruction zeroizes a cache-block at the effective-address read from register _rs_.
It is equivalent to series of byte-sized writes whose value equals zero to all bytes in a cache block.
An implementation may write any number of bytes in the cache block atomically.
The instruction is not guaranteed to allocate the cache block in the cache specified by level.
