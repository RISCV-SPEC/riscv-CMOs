Synopsis::
Provide a HINT to hardware that the cache block containing the effective address
is likely to be accessed by a data write in the near future

Description::
A *prefetch.w* instruction indicates to hardware that the cache block containing
the effective address is likely to be accessed by a data write (i.e. store) in
the near future.

****

_An implementation may opt to cache a copy of the cache block in a cache
accessed by a data write in order to improve memory access latency, but this
behavior is not required._
