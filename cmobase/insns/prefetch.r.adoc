Description::
A *prefetch.r* instruction indicates to hardware that the cache block containing
the effective address is likely to be accessed by a data read (i.e. load) in the
near future. An implementation may opt to cache a copy of the cache block in a
cache accessed by a data read in order to improve memory access latency, but
this behavior is _not_ required.
