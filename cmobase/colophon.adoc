The Zicmobase extension adds a base set of _cache management operation_ (or _CMO_) instructions and CSRs to the RISC-V architecture.
The base extension includes several classes of instructions that operate on cache blocks:

* A set of cache block management instructions, i.e. `CBO.INVAL`, `CBO.CLEAN`, and `CBO.FLUSH`
* A cache block write instruction, i.e. `CBO.ZERO`
* A set of cache block hint instructions, i.e. `PREFETCH.R`, `PREFETCH.W`, `PREFETCH.I`, and `DEMOTE`

The execution of these instructions in various privilege modes is controlled by a set of CSRs.

In addition, this specification introduces architectural abstractions for caches and system topologies to support portable software across various system designs.
