== Control and Status Register State

****

_The CMO extensions rely on state in {csrname} CSRs that will be defined in a
future update to the privileged architecture. If this CSR update is not
ratified, the CMO extension will define its own CSRs._

****

Three CSRs control the execution of CMO instructions:

* `m{csrname}`
* `s{csrname}`
* `h{csrname}`

The `s{csrname}` register is used by all supervisor modes, including VS-mode. A
hypervisor is responsible for saving and restoring `s{csrname}` on guest context
switches. The `h{csrname}` register is only present if the H-extension is
implemented and enabled.

Each `x{csrname}` register (where `x` is `m`, `s`, or `h`) has the following
generic format:

.Generic Format for x{csrname} CSRs
[cols="^10,^10,80a"]
|===
| Bits    | Name     | Description

| [5:4]   | `CBIE`   | Cache Block Invalidate instruction Enable

Enables the execution of the cache block invalidate instruction, `CBO.INVAL`, in
a lower privilege mode:

* `00`: The instruction raises an illegal instruction or virtual instruction
  exception
* `01`: The instruction is executed and performs a flush operation
* `10`: _Reserved_
* `11`: The instruction is executed and performs an invalidate operation

| [6]     | `CBCFE`  | Cache Block Clean and Flush instruction Enable

Enables the execution of the cache block clean instruction, `CBO.CLEAN`, and the
cache block flush instruction, `CBO.FLUSH`, in a lower privilege mode:

* `0`: The instruction raises an illegal instruction or virtual instruction
  exception
* `1`: The instruction is executed

| [7]     | `CBZE`   | Cache Block Zero instruction Enable

Enables the execution of the cache block zero instruction, `CBO.ZERO`, in a
lower privilege mode:

* `0`: The instruction raises an illegal instruction or virtual instruction
  exception
* `1`: The instruction is executed

|===

The x{csrname} registers control CBO instruction execution based on the current
privilege mode and the state of the appropriate CSRs, as detailed below.

A `CBO.INVAL` instruction executes or raises either an illegal instruction
exception or a virtual instruction exception based on the state of the
`x{csrname}.CBIE` fields:

[source,sail,subs="attributes+"]
--

// illegal instruction exceptions
if (((priv_mode != M) && (m{csrname}.CBIE == 00)) ||
    ((priv_mode == U) && (s{csrname}.CBIE == 00)))
{
  <raise illegal instruction exception>
}
// virtual instruction exceptions
else if (((priv_mode == VS) && (h{csrname}.CBIE == 00)) ||
         ((priv_mode == VU) && ((h{csrname}.CBIE == 00) || (s{csrname}.CBIE == 00))))
{
  <raise virtual instruction exception>
}
// execute instruction
else
{
  if (((priv_mode != M) && (m{csrname}.CBIE == 01)) ||
      ((priv_mode == U) && (s{csrname}.CBIE == 01)) ||
      ((priv_mode == VS) && (h{csrname}.CBIE == 01)) ||
      ((priv_mode == VU) && ((h{csrname}.CBIE == 01) || (s{csrname}.CBIE == 01))))
  {
    <execute CBO.INVAL and perform flush operation>
  }
  else
  {
    <execute CBO.INVAL and perform invalidate operation>
  }
}

****

_Until a modified cache block has updated memory, a `CBO.INVAL` instruction may
expose stale data values in memory if the CSRs are programmed to perform an
invalidate operation. This behavior may result in a security hole if lower
privileged level software performs an invalidate operation and accesses
sensitive information in memory._

_To avoid such holes, higher privileged level software must perform either a
clean or flush operation on the cache block before permitting lower privileged
level software to perform an invalidate operation on the block. Alternatively,
higher privileged level software may program the CSRs so that `CBO.INVAL`
either traps or performs a flush operation in a lower privileged level._

****

A `CBO.CLEAN` or `CBO.FLUSH` instruction executes or raises an illegal
instruction or virtual instruction exception based on the state of the
`x{csrname}.CBCFE` bits:

[source,sail,subs="attributes+"]
--

// illegal instruction exceptions
if (((priv_mode != M) && !m{csrname}.CBCFE) ||
    ((priv_mode == U) && !s{csrname}.CBCFE))
{
  <raise illegal instruction exception>
}
// virtual instruction exceptions
else if (((priv_mode == VS) && !h{csrname}.CBCFE) ||
         ((priv_mode == VU) && !(h{csrname}.CBCFE && s{csrname}.CBCFE)))
{
  <raise virtual instruction exception>
}
// execute instruction
else
{
  <execute CBO.CLEAN or CBO.FLUSH>
}

--

Finally, a `CBO.ZERO` instruction executes or raises an illegal instruction or
virtual instruction exception based on the state of the `x{csrname}.CBZE` bits:

[source,sail,subs="attributes+"]
--

// illegal instruction exceptions
if (((priv_mode != M) && !m{csrname}.CBZE) ||
    ((priv_mode == U) && !s{csrname}.CBZE))
{
  <raise illegal instruction exception>
}
// virtual instruction exceptions
else if (((priv_mode == VS) && !h{csrname}.CBZE) ||
         ((priv_mode == VU) && !(h{csrname}.CBZE && s{csrname}.CBZE)))
{
  <raise virtual instruction exception>
}
// execute instruction
else
{
  <execute CBO.ZERO>
}

--

The CBIE/CBCFE/CBZE fields in each `x{csrname}` register do not affect the
read and write behavior of the same fields in the other `x{csrname}` registers.

Each `x{csrname}` register is WARL; however, software should determine the legal
values from the execution environment discovery mechanism.
