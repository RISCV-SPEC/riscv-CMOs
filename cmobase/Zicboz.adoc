=== Cache-Block Zero Instructions

Cache-block zero instructions store zeros to the set of bytes corresponding to a
cache block. An implementation may update the bytes in any order and with any
granularity and atomicity, including individual bytes.

****

_Cache-block zero instructions store zeros independently of whether data from
the underlying memory locations are cacheable. In addition, this specification
does not constrain how the bytes are written._

****

These instructions operate on the cache block, or the memory locations
corresponding to the cache block, whose effective address is specified in _rs1_.
The effective address is translated into a corresponding physical address by the
appropriate translation mechanisms.

The following instructions comprise the Zicboz extension:
