This is NOT supposed to be a [[List of interesting topics related to CMOs]].  That shopuld live elsewhere, although it will undoubtedly be crosslinked with this agenda.

This agenda is intended to reflect technical decisions and issues that must be settle in order to acheive consensus as to one or more RISC-V extensions for CMOs.

# Location History of CMOs TG Agenda

Current home of agenda - see [CMOs TG agenda on Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--__AiQkusBoIGCLiXfod_yXCfjwQTmdWEnvCa3hbBw/edit#)

Originally created in https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/wiki/Agenda-for-CMOs-TG

Then moved to https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-cmo/wiki/23454
when I realized that the GitHub wiki did not allot out copy/paste of HTML text with links

And now moved to Google Docs https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--__AiQkusBoIGCLiXfod_yXCfjwQTmdWEnvCa3hbBw/edit#

When I started worrying about continuous incremental backup.

I then quickly learned  how much I hate the fact that Google Docs does not allow you to create links to pages that do not exist yet the way wiki does. This was almost enough to make me switch over to using Microsoft OneNote using OneDrive -  but the lack of nested sections within sections sent me back to Google Drive. 

There is no single satisfactory solution,  that matches all of my criteria.
