Because I am a bit obsessive about this sort of thing, I will here extract the text of this disclaimer. However, note that this extracted text may be obsoleted if the disclaimer in an official place is edited, so please refer to the Google Drive link if necessary, and to any other official place it may be moved to in the future. NOTE:  Google search did not find this for me (Does Google search ever index Google Drive?), but did return similar documents Such as those whose URLs are in the below:
