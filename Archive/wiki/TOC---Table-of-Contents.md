The github wiki apparently has online macros such as TOC (Table Of Contents) disabled.

That's okay, I've written TOCs for other wikis that operate offline.  Not yet using here.

This just a baby first step: links extracted.

* TBD: hand edit to logical structure.
* TBD: delete non-TOC links
* TBD: collect non-linked / non-TOC'ed pages

Issues

Dang, no easy crosslinking between Github wiki and issues.

TBD:  auto generate  issue summaries

* not for all, but for important pending issues
* TBD: mark in the issue database?


Official GitHub repo issues:

* https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/issues/2

Original/personal issues:

* https://github.com/AndyGlew/Ri5-stuff/issues/2
  * Verify that the recommended [[partial instruction completion loop constructs]] for CMOs operate correctly if optional prefetches or hints are treated as NOPs. #2
  # TBD: migrate  pending issues from personal to official CMOs  depository

===

TBD: this is badly out of datae - so out of date,  it  should be abandoned if the scripts are not rerun soon. 2020-08-12
