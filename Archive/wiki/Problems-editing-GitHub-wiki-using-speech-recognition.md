TBD: move to https://github.com/AndyGlew/Ag-stuff/wiki

I am having a bit of writer's block composing

[[CMOs (Cache Management Operations)]],
specifically the list of [[Actual CMO Operations]] for consideration.

Not only is this long list something I want to be able to automatically extract tables from, keeping in think

But I'm also just plain having trouble composing this text using Dragon speech recognition, which I use because of my computeritis.

Oh, shit: I think the problem was that I was using the wrong web browser.  

Dragon speech control was not working in Microsoft Edge. I was confused, hitting my head against the wall, since these were things that I had already been doing! Ironically, I am/was using Microsoft Edge because supposedly Microsoft Edge has better speech support. Most annoying, the extension had been somehow disabled.

Similarly, speech control is not working in Firefox. Which I was also trying to switch to.

But... The Dragon extension for chrome is working in my personal chrome profile.

It was not working in my Si5 chrome profile. I suppose it is a good thing that the different profiles have different sets of extensions, but it tripped me out. It's working now that the extension is installed.

Yes, now I can...

Shit, I was pulling out my hair over this for several days !! :-)   I would have investigated it earlier, but there was always email that I could quickly reply to.
