# WIP: repo/wiki splitting into top and -discuss

[[issues wrt repo and wiki split]]

# riscv-CMOs/wiki/Home.md

Welcome to riscv-CMOs/wiki ... This may not be the wiki you are looking for. Not if you wat to discuss and post wiki-style.  This repo and wiki are 

The CMOs TG has more than one GitHub repo, each with their associated wiki.

* riscv-CMOs
    * [repo](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs), [wiki](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/wiki)
    * for administrivia, meeting minutes, draft proposals, etc.
        * should only be changed by limited group - TG chair co-chair, helpers...
        * world readable, as is most RISC-V stuff, GitHub and elsewhere
    * https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs ...

* riscv-CMOs-discuss
    * [repo](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs-discuss), [wiki](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs-discuss/wiki)
    * for discussion, e,g, in wiki
         * should be changeable by all CMOs TG members (who have a GitHub account, contact chairs for permissions...)
         * world readable, as is most RISC-V stuff, GitHub and elsewhere
    * possibly other stuff ... 
         * e.g. post slides/docs you want to discuss present here, wherther in wiki or repo - nicer than email fly-by
         *  ... although if we want to reddice chances of accidetally disapearing, may move to [riscv-CMOs](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs)
    * https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs-discuss ...

Why separate repos?  Permissions - GitHub seems to only have per-repo access control, not separate wiki/repo, and not per file or folder in repo.
* It will be embarrassing if this is incorrect, if GitHub has fine grain access control. Please tell me if it does!!!

Originally, we only had a single repo [riscv-CMOs](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs), mixing both.
We knew from the start that we wanted different permissions. 
RISC-V overall wasted much time wasted thrashing - should we move to Google Drive/Docs? Confluence? GitLab? Stay with Groups.io?

Circa 2020-11-09 RISC-V settled on GitHub for TG meeting minutes.

11/12/2020-11-12: 
* CMOs TG got separate GitHub repos for access control
* 12th and 13th: original [riscv-CMOs](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs) duplicated, with history, to [riscv-CMOs-discuss](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs-discuss) => both start out almost exactly the same at tis time.

WIP 11/12/2020-11-13: 
* disentangling, separating the repos. Mainly, deleting stuff.
* submodule structure

# Home.md - this file's status, old and new -discuss wikis

"Merging"
* new riscv-CMOs-discuss/wiki/Home.md
* and old new riscv-CMOs/wiki/Home.md

by concatenating.

Subsequently will separate.
# original Home.md for new riscv-CMOs-discuss/wiki
 
The new GitHub repo riscv-CMOs-discuss and its wiki

were created so that we can split the old GitHub repo riscv-CMOs and wiki

into two pieces

riscv-CMOs + wiki
* readable by the world
* writable - restricted to TG chairs and maintainers

riscv-CMOs-discuss + wiki
* readable by the world
* writable - by all CMOs TG members
    * at first, mainly for wiki access

At the time of writing (2020-11-12) I am propagating the old wiki to this new wiki.  Have already done so for the main repo.


# old riscv-CMOs/wiki/Home.md

...the below...

# riscv-CMOs wiki

This is the wiki for the RISC-V CMOs (Cache Management Operations) Technical Group.

[[RISC-V standard disclaimer]]

## CMO TG meeting minutes

RISC-V thrashed a lot wrt where stuff like TG minutes should be placed.  Email... Groups.io files... Groups.io wiki... Github wiki... Github repo...Google drive... Confluence wiki...

As of 2020-11-08, there is a policy -  put the minutes in the GitHub code repo, not in the GitHub wiki, and not anywhere else.

As a result of the thrashing, this TG minutes are  in several different places

* older minutes on email - will be moved here

* wiki: [[Meeting 11-09-2020]]

*  and now the official 
     * https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/tree/master/agendas-and-minutes

TBD/WIP: Gather/collect  and link/copy old minutes here, so that they can be found.   This may be a low priority task, as long as future minutes are placed here



## [[How to search this wiki, repo, issues, etc.]]

## [[Administrivia]]

### CMO TG

Chair: Andy Glew (SiFive)

Vice-chair: David Kruckemyer (Ventana)

GitHub riscv/riscv-CMOs [repo](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs) and [wiki](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/wiki)
* note: repo has wiki as a git submodule. C;one'ing using SSH works; cloning via HTTPS has problems, e.g. GitHub desktop client
* As of Sept 2020, the GitHub repo - especially the wiki - is the true "home" of most of the CMO TG

Traditional RISC-V TG "homepage": https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-cmo
* NOTE: inconsistent spelling: "CMOs" on GitHub, but "cmo" on lists.riscv.org
* Although the wiki has most "home" info, including proposals andf agendae, lists.riscv.org is the hub for stuff like
    * Mailing list: tech-cmo@lists.riscv.org
       * subscription info
       * email messages archive: https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-cmo/topics
       * yet another wiki
* files: https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-smo/files
   * not used as of Sept 2020
   * but may be used in future if we need access restricted to members

Calendar:
* CMO TG meetings are posted on https://sites.google.com/a/riscv.org/risc-v-staff/home/tech-groups-cal
  * as are all RISC-V TG meetings - all on the same calendar
* ical: Â https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/c_sumcgd4h4k09ktuppmqjb27o1s%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics
* Zoom links will be posted in the calendar item
  * or possibly in a file in https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-smo/files, linked to friom the calendar item
  * but will NOT be sebt in email.


Issue Tracking: on the GitHub wiki https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/issues

Network locations - GitHub repo, wiki, mailing lists, etc.

See [[TOC - Table of Contents]]
  * almost certainly out of date
  * TBD: [[automate generation and update of wiki TOC]] as wiki evolves

## Where else is CMOs TG stuff?

### Wikis: there are too many wikis... 

Original GitHub wiki https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/wiki
   * the "main" wiki as of Sept 2020
       * 2020-11-13: WIP: splitting off discussion into the new [-discuss wiki](ttps://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs-discuss/wiki
   * contains a draft CMO proposal
   * clone as a submodule of the GitHub (code) repo https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs

New [-discuss wiki ](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs-discuss/wiki) 
   * 2020-11-13: WIP: splitting off from the older [top repo wiki](ttps://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/wiki) as of November 2020
   * CMO TG members can Post discussions to this wiki...
   * 2020-11-13:  beware: contains stale information like stale draft CMO proposal

Groups.io wiki: https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-cmo/wiki
   * not used as of Sept 22, 2020
   * big advantage over the GitHub wiki: allows copy-paste of bitmap images, e.g. diagrams - easier than up0loading image files

Confluence -  yet another RISC-V wiki - https://wiki.riscv.org.
   * for a while it looks like we were going to have to move things like CMO TG  minutes and other pages to this wiki
   * as of 2020-11-13  will not see much use, perhaps just pointers to the GitHub wiki
   * pro/con:  like the Groups.io wiki, can copy.paste bitmaps,  and all the other good stuff that the GitHub wiki cannot do 
   * See [CMO TG page on wiki.riscv.org](https://wiki.riscv.org/display/TECH/CMO+%28Cache+Management+Operations%29+TG)

Other wiki-like stuff:

* Google Drive
   * RISC-V has an official Google Drive. TBD: link
   * [[Google Drive is not a wiki]]  although some people mistake it for one
   * TBD:  link/collect old CMO stuff  from the Google Drive


## Filesystems:  again, there are/were to many...

GitHub -  main file storage for CMOs TG
* https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs
* https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs-discuss

Note:  files may also have been uploaded to the corresponding GitHub wikis...

Groups.io file storage : https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-cmo/files
   * not used by the CMOs TG 
   * although historically used by other TGs, like security

Google Drive
   * RISC-V has an official Google Drive. TBD: link
   * 2020-11-13:  not being used for most CMO.TG discussion and work
   *  however, RISC-V CTO and program management require TG status to be updated in various places on this drive
       * TBD: link   

Again, note that files may have been or may yet be uploaded to any of the several too many wikis 
   * Approved
      *  [top wiki riscv-CMOs/wiki](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs.wiki)
      *  [discussion  wiki riscv-CMOs-discuss/wiki](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs-discuss.wiki)
   * Please avoid
      * Ri5 Confluence: [CMO TG page on wiki.riscv.org](https://wiki.riscv.org/display/TECH/CMO+%28Cache+Management+Operations%29+TG)
      * [old Groups.io wiki](https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-cmo/wiki)
    * Mentioned only  increase you really do need to go hunting for something maybe put in the wrong place
