 I like wikis.

 however, I find it necessary to use voice recognition (Dragon on a PC)  to enter text because of computeritis

 unfortunately, the GitHub/Gollum wiki, edited online in an editor like Google Chrome,   has many problems when edited using voice recognition.

For example: The double letters ii and oo  highlighted below

> I am actually just as happy not to **defiine** the CSR operand to **coontain ** an encoding of CMO operations desired, 

 I apologize for such errors in the current wiki text. I will correct them as I find them during review. I can avoid them if I edit off-line  using software that is more ready for speech recognition. However sometimes I make these edits online, just for efficieency. ( There is another typo **ee** :-( )
