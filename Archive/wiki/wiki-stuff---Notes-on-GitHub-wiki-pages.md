Is it possible that this GitHub wiki does not allow me to create a reference to a page that does not yet exist?

To me, that is the essence of wiki.

False alarm: links to pages that do not exist yet work.  At least in Markdown.  I think also in Asciidoc wiki pages.  Mostly with the [[Markdown link syntax in Asciidoc wiki pages]]. But I believe also with traditional Asciidoc links - thdy are just harder to type.  

Also, annoyingly, Asciidoc wiki pages do not color links that do not exist distinct from links that do exist.  That is probably my second most iomportant wiki property.
