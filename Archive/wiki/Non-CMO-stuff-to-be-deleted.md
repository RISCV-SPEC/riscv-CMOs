The https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/ repo and wiki 
were forked from a personal repo and wiki
https://github.com/AndyGlew/Ri5-stuff
that also contained non-CMO stuff.

The non-CMO stuff should be deleted.

## Other - non-CMO topics (to be deleted from riscv-CMOs repo+wiki)


### Aside:
   * [[Problems editing GitHub wiki using speech recognition]]


### Side: multipart LUT4 instruction in RV32 for the crypto extension
  * looks like this is now part of the crypto proposal

### Supporter:
* [[in-band tagging pointers]]
   * I am very interested in proposals for using some bits of pointers to improve... stuff like security, sandboxing, etc.
   * although: in my own work, capabilities inspired,
      * I have deprecated some such approaches as only 15/16ths secure (4 bits, get it?)
      * since my own capabilities projects were either cancelled or emasculated, I'll take 15/16ths over 0/16ths

### Possible future topics for RISC-V

* [[Quantization, dequantization, and interpolation instructions  for DL, math, etc.]]
