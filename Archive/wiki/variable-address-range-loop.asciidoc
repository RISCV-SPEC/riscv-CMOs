// The CMO.VAR instruction is intended to be used in a software loop such as that below:


In pseudocode:

----
x11 := lwb
x12 := upb (= lwb + size_in_bytes)
LOOP
   CMO.VAR.<> x11,x11,x12
UNTIL x1 ==x12
----

In assembly code:

----
    x11 := lwb
    x12 := upb
L:  CMO.VAR.<> x11,x11,x12
    bne x11,x12,L
----
