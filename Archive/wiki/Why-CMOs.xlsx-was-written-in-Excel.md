CMOs.xlsx, in GitHub repo at https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/blob/master/CMOs.xlsx
is a "list" of CMOs. Not exactly a list, more like a table from which the actual list can be generated.

I am in bit embarrassed that I wrote this in Excel, since I prefer to use open tools, easily parseable by scripts etc.

The main reason I wrote this in Excel is that I wanted arrows in my spreadsheet stuck to cells of the spreadsheet. Similarly diagrams.

(Oh, f***: I would have pasted a screen-snip of the diagrams here. But this wiki does not support pasting of images, instead you have to save the image as a separate file. This is another shortcoming of a tool that would make me like to switch to something more capable.)

Google Sheets does not seem to have this feature. In Google sheets you can draw arrows etc. on top of your spreadsheet, but if the cells are resized the arrow stayed the same size and you have to manually adjust them.

TBD: can OpenOffice provide this feature? I have not yet tried.


Similarly, I rely on the ability to collapse groups of rows and/or columns.

I would actually like to use pivot charts for this, but Excel pivot charts are insufficiently powerful.
