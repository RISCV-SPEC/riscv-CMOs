Cache Management Operations (CMOs) for RISC-V

* Created by: 	Stephano Cetola
* Requested by: 	Andy Glew

TBD: working group

TBD: riscv group, including mailing list
* should eventually have the typical riscv.org setup,
  probably https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-CMOs
  but not set up yet

GitHub locations
* https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs
* https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/wiki
* TBD: links that work when checked out locally as well as on GitHub


Note: wiki more than repo: 
  * at the moment / at start, much of this will be in the wiki rather than the repo
    * since much of my (Glew's) initial proposal was arranged in such a wiki-centric manner, with the repo mainly for build tools
  * if this continues, the repo will mainly hold support stuff such as Makefile and tools to generate documents
    * TBD: set up git modules so that repo has wiki as a submodule, and versioned together
