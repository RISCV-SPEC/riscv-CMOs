    * [Email announcing first meeting of CMO TG, out-of-cycle, Wed 9-23, 5pm ](https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-cmo/topic/out_of_cycle_meeting_rv/76917401?p=,,,100,0,0,0::recentpostdate%2Fsticky,,,100,1,0,76917401)
* testing to see how/if notifications of repo and wiki posts get sent to list (and if that will be too annoying)
  * it seems that main repo integrations will get email notifications, but not wiki checkins
  * both look too annoying - I will probably disable them by default.  Folks can add them themselves if they wish.
