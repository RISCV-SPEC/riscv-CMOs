This wiki is for work on a proposal for RISC-V.

Therefore, any status of along the lines of "almost done?" Is always contingent on whether it will be accepted by the working group(s) to which it is being applied.

Therefore, [[STATUS: almost done - maybe]] means that from my point of view, the authors point of view, it is reasonably complete and has started being acceptable from key bottleneck reviewers.

TBD: [[Proposal Status Tags]].
