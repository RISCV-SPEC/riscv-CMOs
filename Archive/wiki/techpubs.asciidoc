== TechPubs Thrashing
=== Wiki --> AsciiDoc
This proposal was developed on a wiki,
originally https://github.com/AndyGlew/Ri5-stuff/wiki/CMOs-proposal,
later https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/wiki/CMOs-proposal,
as a set of interlinked pages,
and is in the process of being converted to more compact AsciiDoc proposl

Why?:

* Wikis get messy.
    * Proliferation of pages.
    * Hard to tell which pages are part of the official proposal in which pages are just random commentary
        *  at least it's hard unless you develop tools to do this, I don't want to spend the time to do it
* AsciiDoc seems to be the closest thing RISC-V has to a standard documentation format
    * Although it is by no means standard as of 2020-05-06
       * the original manuals were written in TeX
       * some AsciiDoc
       * some in Word, PowerPoint, ...

=== Redundant AsciiDoc files?

* link:CMOs-proposal[] - original, then thrashed trying to get asciidoc to build
* link:Ri5-CMOs-proposal[] - asciidoc created elsewhere


=== Thrashed wrt Location

* Originally in wiki https://github.com/AndyGlew/Ri5-stuff/wiki/CMOs-proposal
* Moved to repo
  * repo: https://github.com/AndyGlew/Ri5-CMOs-proposal/blob/master/Ri5-CMOs-proposal
  * document: https://github.com/AndyGlew/Ri5-CMOs-proposal/blob/master/Ri5-CMOs-proposal.adoc

Why?

* GitHub wiki does not support includes
* Git does not ad-hoc subrepo checkouts
  *  although I expect some idiot is going to tell me that sparse checkouts are good enough. They are not.

Then moved back to original repo/wiki
* the wiki is a submodule of the repo
* wiki https://github.com/AndyGlew/Ri5-stuff/wiki/CMOs-proposal
* repo https://github.com/AndyGlew/Ri5-stuff
   * where tools such as Makefile are kept
      * Makefile lives in repo
      * HTML is grnerated in wiki
         * where can be linked
