I was remarkably slow figuring out how to search this wiki.

See [HOW-TO: search wiki on GitHub](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsM0rpNELR4xgQm9sCzSiwsl_KjJ?wd=target%28HOW-TO.one%7C9FD63E37-17E4-4075-AEB2-593259BBE1C5%2FHOW-TO%3A%20search%20wiki%20on%20GitHub%7CAC5F362B-239A-416C-8405-D59AD13F1791%2F%29)

BRIEF: standard GitHub search using the search box in the upper left-hand corner works, but you  must remember to change the "view", to look at the wiki items returned. By default you will only be looking at the code items, and there may be none. WARNING: if you have a narrow window, you may not see the count of wiki items returned by the search.  if you miss the horizontal scrollbar ...

The [search](../search?q=ENTER-QUERY-HERE&type=wikis) link here and in the sidebar is an attempt to make this friendlier, by setting the view returned by the link to be wikis,  but you will have to fill in the search term in the new page.

In fact, I was on the verge of giving up on the GitHub wiki, instead migrating to RISC V's new official Confluence wiki, https://wiki.riscv.org. 
See [CMO TG page on wiki.riscv.org](https://wiki.riscv.org/display/TECH/CMO+%28Cache+Management+Operations%29+TG).

I may still  migrate to Confluence, to get other good features like copy/paste of links and formatted text and images, and better access control.
 But at least now I figured out how to search this GitHub wiki.
