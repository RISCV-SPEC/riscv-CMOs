This proposal for CMOs was prepared by Andy Glew,
and is a start for discussion of the CMO TG.

There may be other proposals from opthe TG members.
TBD: copy here and/or link  there.

The https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/ repo and wiki were forked from a personal repo and wiki https://github.com/AndyGlew/Ri5-stuff that also contained non-CMO stuff.


## "Released" Proposal - what you are probably looking for

As of Sept 2020 there is not really a "release" procedure.
PDF and HTML are preparted in an offline clone of the repo+wiki, and pushed to GitHub.

TBD: imitate the main and V specs, automatically generating PDF and HTML on the GitHub servers on checkin/push.
(Not just push, as long as we continue to use a proposal embedded in the wiki.)

TBD: fix the tools so that the work on systems other than Andy Glew's personal PC with cygwin.

## Work in Progress (WIP)

Sept 2020: [[Administrivia - CMOS TG]]
* mailing list running - lots of traffic
* first meetings scheduled (see page)
* testing to see how/if notifications of repo and wiki posts get sent to list (and if that will be too annoying)

Jan-Aug 2020: [[CMOs (Cache Management Operations)]]

* [[RISC-V needs CMOs, and hence a CMO Working Group]]
* [[CMOs WG Draft Proposed Charter]]
* [[Mailing lists interested in CMOs]]

* [[Draft CMO proposals]]
   * I (Glew) created a draft CMO proposal
      *  originally in my personal GitHub https://github.com/AndyGlew/Ri5-stuff/wiki/Ri5-CMOs-proposal
      *  eventually in official GitHub https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/wiki/Ri5-CMOs-proposal
   * TBD: migrate that to riscv.org wiki
   * See issue https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/issues/2
* [[CMOs cut across many fields]]

* [[Ri5-CMOs-proposal]]
    * See [[generated HTML and PDF for CMOs proposal]]

* [[Use Cases for CMOs and Prefetches]]
   * See above, in particular [[Mailing lists interested in CMOs]]
   * TBD: formalize CMO use cases  for use in tracking progress,  ensuring coverage, and restricting scope




## [[Administrivia]]

Network locations - GitHub repo, wiki, mailing lists, etc.

See [[TOC - Table of Contents]]
  * almost certainly out of date
  * TBD: [[automate generation and update of wiki TOC]] as wiki evolves
