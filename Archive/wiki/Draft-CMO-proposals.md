* [[Draft CMO proposals]]
   * I (Glew) created a draft CMO proposal
     * old: originally in my personal GitHub https://github.com/AndyGlew/Ri5-stuff/wiki/Ri5-CMOs-proposal
         * TBD: remove reference
     * new: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/wiki/Ri5-CMOs-proposal
         * [[generated-HTML-and-PDF-for-CMOs-proposal]] (local)
         * on web: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/wiki/generated-HTML-and-PDF-for-CMOs-proposal

   * See issue https://github.com/riscv/riscv-CMOs/issues/2
     * update issue with migration status

I expect other working group members will have their own proposals, whether full or in part, and will provide links here as they become available.

TBD: links to generated versions
* OLD: Glew personal wiki: https://github.com/AndyGlew/Ri5-stuff/wiki/generated-HTML-and-PDF-for-CMOs-proposal
